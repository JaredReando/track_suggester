#### By _**Jared Reando**_

## Description

_A short survey to determine which Epicodus coding track could be right for you based on your learning interests. View a hosted version of this project [here] (https://www.jaredreando.github.io/track_suggester)_

## Setup/Installation Requirements

* Clone this project to your local drive: https://github.com/JaredReando/track_suggester.git
* Open the index.html file in the browser of your choice.
* To make changes of your own to this project, open the downloaded directory files into a developer text-editing program. I use _[Atom] (https://atom.io/)._


_{Leave nothing to chance! You want it to be easy for potential users, employers and collaborators to run your app. Do I need to run a server? How should I set up my databases? Is there other code this app depends on?}_

## Known Bugs

_{Still learning how to properly nest and space content. Text and formatting look a little odd, and I can't quite get the background image to scale the way I'd like with the rest of the page content. Overall, the site is embarrassingly bad in its current state. Will update further before grading on Tuesday.}_

## Support and contact details

_{Please direct all constructive criticism and frenzied praise to my personal email: jaredreando@gmail.com}_

## Technologies Used

_{My main goal with this project was to wrap my head around <div> tags and nested rows and columns. I also experimented at length with the site's aesthetic possibilities by adjusting object opacities, image scaling, and element positioning. Custom classes to override/modify Bootstrap features were also a major part of my work on this project, as I am still plodding through the CSS and Bootstrap documentation to learn it's expanded feature set.}_
